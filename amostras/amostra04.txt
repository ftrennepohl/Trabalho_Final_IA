This is a Paternoster lift. There are only a few working examples of these left in the world, like this one at the Arts Tower of Sheffield University. It is an open elevator shaft with a series of connected carriages going round and round and round in it on a constant loop. One side goes up, and one side goes down, and you just get in and out. This is a 20-storey building, by the way, so this is a long chain. A Paternoster can carry more passengers than a regular lift, although obviously there's a little bit more danger of trips, falls, and injuries. This particular lift has a lot of extra safety features to stop people getting injured too. But for that reason, and because they're inaccessible to anyone who can't walk or is carrying big things or can't walk well, and because there aren't many companies in the world that build or refurbish them anymore, they aren't installed. And those that are left tend to get ripped out of old buildings in the place. But Sheffield kept theirs, and they also have some more standard lifts, just in case. Now, I can't stay in this lift as it goes over the top, thank you Chris. I'd unbalance the whole thing, and I would risk it getting shut down and the fire brigade coming in and turfing me out. But what I can do is leave this little GoPro camera in to show you what it's like to go over the top. So... I'll see you in a couple of minutes. Here we go. See you in a minute. I'm looking forward to seeing the footage from this.
