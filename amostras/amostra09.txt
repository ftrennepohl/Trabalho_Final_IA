They were out and about the other day, catching people speeding on the river. What? Where the speed limit, we were told, is 7.4 kilometres an hour. What's that? Four and a half? Four and a half. That's walking pace. I could swim faster than that. They're going to be prosecuting poo sticks. That stick is speeding. It's this obsession everybody's got now that speed kills. It doesn't. Speed has never killed anyone. Suddenly becoming stationary. That's what gets you. That's the killer. That will do it.
