I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can't combat me They tell me, "Jesus walks", I tell them, "Money talks" Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an icebox They tell me I've been sleeping, I say, "I'm wide awake" Tracks hot and ready so they call me Mister Easy-Bake They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain The people always different but it always feels the same That's the real me, pop the champagne The haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin' at the pain Stayin' still, eyes closed Let the world just pass me by Pain pills, nice clothes If I fall, I think I'll fly Touch me, Midas Make me part of your design None to guide us I feel fear for the very last time They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red" They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me? Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feeling odd No matter what I make, they never see mistakes Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above The people blend together but I would be lost without their love Can you heal me? Have I gained too much? When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch Is there a real me? Pop the champagne It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain Stayin' still, eyes closed Let the world just pass me by Pain pills, nice clothes If I fall, I think I'll fly Touch me, Midas Make me part of your design None to guide us I feel fear for the very last time Lay still, restless Losing sleep while I lose my mind All thrill, no stress All my muses left behind (left behind) World is below So high up, I'm near-divine (I'm so high up) Lean in, let go I feel fear for the very last time

This is a Paternoster lift. There are only a few working examples of these left in the world, like this one at the Arts Tower of Sheffield University. It is an open elevator shaft with a series of connected carriages going round and round and round in it on a constant loop. One side goes up, and one side goes down, and you just get in and out. This is a 20-storey building, by the way, so this is a long chain. A Paternoster can carry more passengers than a regular lift, although obviously there's a little bit more danger of trips, falls, and injuries. This particular lift has a lot of extra safety features to stop people getting injured too. But for that reason, and because they're inaccessible to anyone who can't walk or is carrying big things or can't walk well, and because there aren't many companies in the world that build or refurbish them anymore, they aren't installed. And those that are left tend to get ripped out of old buildings in the place. But Sheffield kept theirs, and they also have some more standard lifts, just in case. Now, I can't stay in this lift as it goes over the top, thank you Chris. I'd unbalance the whole thing, and I would risk it getting shut down and the fire brigade coming in and turfing me out. But what I can do is leave this little GoPro camera in to show you what it's like to go over the top. So... I'll see you in a couple of minutes. Here we go. See you in a minute. I'm looking forward to seeing the footage from this.

 This is a pattern of still lift. There are only a few working examples of these left in the world. Like this one at the Arts Tower of Sheppel University.

This is a 20 story building by the way, so this is a long chain. A pattern of still can carry more passengers than a regular lift or by obviously a little bit more danger of trips, and injeers.

And those are RLF to tend to get ripped out of old buildings and replaced, but sheffield kept theirs, and they also have some more standard lifts just in case. Now I can't stay in this lift as it goes over the top. Thank you Chris. I don't balance the whole thing and I would risk it heading shut down and the fire brigade coming in and surfing me out.

I'm on the 94 of one kind of square in London. And that is a gorgeous sunset. This is an Ohamstone. This is a teach pendant. This is a tease made. This is London's cable car. This is a packet and bottle of freeze-dried urine. Behind me is Lake Constance. It is a big lake. This is a shipping container. This is a Soviet T34 Battle Tank. This is a dead man. This is a bottle of Dassani. This is the mixed reality lab. This is a natural spring. This is launch pad 39. This is the control room. This is Notre Dame. This used to be RAF gravely. This is the terms. This is the kilogram. Up there is the bridge. This is a driverless vehicle. This is non-brewed condiment. These are the solar power towers. That is the angel of the north. This is the Elleissat Icefjord. This is Alkylorto. This is Bruge. This is Hanfaal Puyl Kwingel Kogheri Queen Throbilanti Siliogogogogogogog. Welcome to the town of asbestos. Welcome to Calipatria. Welcome to a town that doesn't exist. Welcome to Wales. The road behind me is closed. This is going to be a fairly disappointing video. I am back in the UK and I have a cold.

Jeremy, now this is really quite simple, OK. Understeer works like this. You drive down the road, you turn the wheel, but the car goes straight on, crashes into a tree, and you die. Oversteer works like this. You drive down the same bit of road, turn the wheel, but the back of the car comes round like this, and you go off the road, crash into a tree, and you die. Now, oversteer is best because you don't see the tree that kills you.

 Now this is really quite simple, OK? Understeer works like this. You drive down the road, you turn the wheel, but the car goes straight on, crashes into a tree, and you die. Oversteer works like this. You drive down the same bit of road, turn the wheel, but the back of the car comes round like this, and you go off the road, crash into a tree, and you die. Now, oversteer is best because you don't see the tree that kills you.

That's walking pace. I could swim faster than that. They're going to be prosecuting poo sticks. That stick is speeding. It's this obsession everybody's got now that speed kills. It doesn't.

When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone. “There are bitter weeds in England.” There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned. I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government, every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.
